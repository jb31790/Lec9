# Tasks

## Task 1: Function Basics
**Objective:** Introduce students to JavaScript functions.
1. Create a simple JavaScript function named `greet` that takes a name as a parameter and returns a greeting message. For example, if the input is "Alice," the function should return "Hello, Alice!" Test the function with different names.


## Task 2: Function Parameters and Return Values
**Objective:** Practice using parameters and return values in functions.
1. Write a function named `calculateCircleArea` that takes the radius of a circle as a parameter and returns its area. Test the function with different radius values.
2. Create another function named `calculateTriangleArea` that takes the base and height of a triangle as parameters and returns its area. Test the function with different values for base and height.


## Task 3: Function Expressions
**Objective:** Introduce function expressions and anonymous functions.
1. Declare a variable `multiply` and assign it an **anonymous function** that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their product. Use this function to calculate the product of two numbers.


## Task 4: Classes and Objects
**Objective:** Explore JavaScript classes and objects.
1. Create a class named `Person` with properties for `name`, `age`, and `email`. Implement a constructor to initialize these properties. Create an instance of the `Person` class and display its properties.
2. Add a method to the `Person` class called `greet` that returns a greeting message including the person's name. Use this method to greet the person similar to the function that you created in task1


## Task 5: Inheritance
**Objective:** Teach inheritance in JavaScript.
1. Create a subclass `Student` that extends the `Person` class. Add an additional property called `studentID` to the `Student` class. Initialize this property in the constructor.
2. Implement a method in the `Student` class that displays the student's information, including their **name**, **age**, **email**, and **student ID**.


## Task 6: Array Operations (Advanced)
**Objective:** Practice array manipulation and operations in JavaScript without using for loops.
1. Create an array named `numbers` and initialize it with a sequence of numbers (e.g., `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`).
2. Use the `map` method to create a new array named `squaredNumbers`. In this new array, each element should be the square of the corresponding element in the `numbers` array.
3. Use the `reduce` method to calculate the sum of all `numbers` in the numbers array and store it in a variable called `totalSum`.
4. Use the `Math.max` method to find the maximum value in the `numbers` array and store it in a variable called `maxValue`.
5. Use the `Math.min` method to find the minimum value in the `numbers` array and store it in a variable called `minValue`.
6. Display the `squaredNumbers` array, `totalSum`, `maxValue`, and `minValue` in the console.

**This updated task uses array methods like `map`, `reduce`, and `Math` functions to perform these operations more efficiently and in a more functional programming style.**
